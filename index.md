# The goal

- a system that generates cash in a somewhat automated and reliable way (not necessarily MRR)
- should be able to do it solo
- makes at least enough money to pay rent and buy personal freedom

We want businesses that have a very obvious main metric ([Main Thing](https://youtu.be/gRxpcmMA548?si=j_Ce4HHxJMBW3hNb&t=1607)) that you can put all your focus on. For example, if you're an influencer, it's your number of followers. If you're running a newsletter, it's your number of subscriptions and open rate. 

The Main Thing is so important that I'll capitalize it every time it's mentioned. If you can just get the Main Thing right, I don't think much else will matter. 

We also want to avoid anything too adventurous, because that usually means it's unpredictable. We want a business that will just work if we focus on optimizing the Main Thing. 

# Software businesses

## SaaS

Usually B2B, i.e. high-touch with a long sales pipeline. Most of your money would come by nurturing leads through calls. Expect a full calendar, with lots of meetings. 

The main metrics (Main Things) in SaaS are LTV, CAC, Churn Rate, and also potentially MAU/DAU

<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:40px">
	<div>
		<h3>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Technically, it's one of the most straightforward paths to monthly recurring revenue.</li>
			<li>If you can find PMF, you can find customers fairly quickly (after the initial dev time)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You'll have to build and maintain the software, and deal with the complexity of engineering</li>
			<li>It'll be high-touch: Leads will need to be nurtured, onboarded, and you'll have to provide ongoing support</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

SaaS can be feasible for a solo entrepreneur if they choose the right market and ICP. 

A bad example is a customer support chat widget like Intercom. That's a B2E business, and those kinds of companies make the majority of their money on deals that take months or years to make.

A good example is datafetcher.com. A plugin that hooks into an existing ecosystem. There are already a lot of users using no-code tools like airtable, and they're receptive and ready to pay for new tools that can solve their problems. 

The main problem is that software is a difficult to build and maintain, which will distract from the Main Thing. 

## Steam Games

Games have long dev times, but if you do it right and focus on the Main Thing, making money seems pretty reliable. 

The Main Things here are playtime, wishlists, and email subscriptions. 

Social media followers are only important because they effect wishlists and email subscriptions.

<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:40px">
	<div>
		<h3>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>PC Gamers are hobbyists and want to spend money to collect games</li>
			<li>There is a LOT of data on what works and what doesn't work. If you build what the market wants, you will probably get sales</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Very high variance in revenue. You make a lot or a little. Often the time investment isn't really worth the outcome</li>
			<li>Very long dev time. You'll also need assets like music and art</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

Some of the cons are manageable: 
- Modern AI can help with assets. Look at nano banana
- Dev time is long but you don't have to be shooting in the dark the whole time. If you get playtesters to test your game mechanics before you've got any art, you'll know if you're going in the right direction or not. 

## Consumer Apps

Most of the time, a really bad business model. But under certain circumstances, it seems feasible, mostly thanks to short-form video. Even though it seems possible, it still doesn't feel predictable enough to confidently recommend. 

The Main Things are reel/tiktok views, downloads, and then in-app purchases. 

short-form video seems like the main strategy to make this work. There are many apps that have seen success by getting accounts to post loads of ugc style videos that turn out to be low-key ads.

For example, here's a recent account I found that advertises Anara in every reel. The formula is to catch people's attention with some relatable scenario, and by the end of the video, guide them to Anara as the solution.

<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:40px">
	<div>
		<h3>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Apps can be fairly simple to build, and can be built to solve a fairly simple problem for a lot of people</li>
			<li>High margins</li>
			<li>CAC can be low if short-form video works</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>App store tax</li>
			<li>A lot of variance/uncertainty at multiple stages of the funnel: how many people will view a short-form video, how many people will download, and how many people will buy?</li>
			<li>AOV and LTV is very low</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

Most of the apps that are successfully using this strategy are AI apps. Which is bad because they have to pay app store tax, the creators, and the inference fee. Too many expenses

One promising direction is something like headspace

# Ecommerce 

At first glance, ecommerce feels like a bad model. CAC is very high, because social ads are a lot more expensive than they used to be. 

But businesses in this space seem to be handling it fairly well, by diverting their focus to LTV. If you focus on repeat customers, CAC starts looking more acceptable. 

"Studies have shown that although [repeat customers](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/repeat-purchases-increase) account for just 21% of a brandâ€™s customer base, they generate almost half of all total revenue. Retaining them is also [five times cheaper](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/) than acquiring new customers." - [Source](https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/blog/lower-customer-acquisition-costs#6)

This makes the Main Things abundantly clear. They are repeat orders. CAC to LTV ratio. And AOV

<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:40px">
	<div>
		<h3>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Main Thing is very clear and fairly predictable if you have other info</li>
			<li>Email works very well, and there are many documented ways to measurably improve core metrics</li>
			<li>Implementation is fairly simple</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Lower margins. Sometimes very low, depending on what you're selling</li>
			<li>You'll lose money on the first order. You won't make much money until 2nd or 3rd</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

There are clear ways to make this business model work well:
- Sell to collectors. People who keep buying the same stuff. I bring up the goth subculture a lot, but their wardrobes are full of the same types of clothes. Sell different items to them one after the other. You'd need a few good products ready to go though
- Sell to women, turn them into fans. Women buy more often, they also spend more time on social media. Use offers and sales and influencers to get inside their heads.
- Use Email, social media, referral marketing (it'll help with CAC), CRO (like, display popular products prominently, show social proof, good checkout page, etc)
- Make their initial experience good, so that they come back

# Content businesses

## Newsletters

There's two ways to monetize newsletters: ads, or paid subscriptions. Both of these are kinda different business models but I'm grouping them together. 

For bot, the Main Things will be subscriber count and open rate. 

In the case of ad-based, the open rate matters because you're going to sell your ads based on that. In the case of paid subscriptions, it matters because if it's low, you're subscribers are going to start churning.

<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:40px">
	<div>
		<h3>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>It's fairly simple because you just have to write and know things</li>
			<li>The Main Thing is fairly clear</li>
			<li>A large email list can go on to become useful as a sales funnel for other things</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>You have to write a lot, and know a lot, constantly</li>
			<li>Growth will probably be quite slow. You won't be making any money for a while</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>

One nice thing about this business model are the tools/platforms available. If you're going for scale, you can use Beehiiv, and their boost network to help grow. Or, you can use substack. 

## YouTube

If you choose the right audience, YouTube is a good path. The Main Things are very clear: watch time and subscriber count. 

If you choose a good niche to serve, you'll have a valuable audience, which means you'll make more ad money, and sponsorship money. E.g. if you make finance related content

<div style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:40px">
	<div>
		<h3>Pros</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Very simple, you need to make videos that people watch</li>
			<li>A large audience can be directed towards another business, or you can at least collect emails</li>
			<li>It seems simple to understand the algorithm and what it wants (based on how well other channels are working), and the algorithm will carry you</li>
			<li>Video is a powerful medium to build a community with, and communities help other kinds of businesses too e.g. will reduce ecommerce CAC</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>Cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Some amount of platform dependence</li>
			<li>The content that will make the most money is probably boring to make</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>
